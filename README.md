## Since you are a fan of funny GitHub commits, I thought I might as well do it here. 

### So I need to tell you a bunch of things. 

I find you:
+ Cute. _Super cute_.
+ Smart. _Super smart_.
+ Funny. _Super funny_. 

And I would love to go out with you sometime and get to know you, if that’s something that you’re interested in as well.

We could go for coffee, or grab a bite somewhere.

And I could tell you some funny/amazing things that cannot go on record ever and I would love to hear what you have to say. 

From what's your _favorite color_ and why, to why you think _Kamala Harris_ is the best bet for the _Democrats in 2020_. From something **trivial** to something that means **everything** to you; and anything and everything in between. I would **_love_** to hear it all! 

I promise this will be **_fun!_**

### But, before you answer that, I also need to tell you a bunch of things.

+ I am your TA, which puts this in an ethical gray zone. I would appreciate if you don’t tell anyone about this _**for now?**_
+ I have **_never_** graded you **_unfairly_**. Whatever scores you may have received from me, are purely on **merit**. I’ve never patronized you and graded you easy nor have I ever graded you harshly. 
+ I’ve been as **_fair_** as possible in my attitude towards you in class and/or slack. I've never tried to do you any undue favors nor have I ever tried to give you a cold shoulder.
+ Your final project is yet to be graded, but I **_will not_** be grading it in the interest of maintaining fairness. 

So, whatever be your decision, it will **_not_** be impacting your grade. 
Or **_anything_** as a matter of fact. 
I will not hold this against you or have hard feelings if this is something you’re not looking forward to. 

## _Remember, **no pressure**_. 


Irrespective of what happens next, I promise the next time I run into you (_at a Starbucks again? lol_) I will beam a huge smile and wave at you. :D

And now that my spiel is over, let me just sum it:

# U cute. U smart. U funny. U amaze. I like u. U wanna go for coffee?

_(Also, take a look at the commits. Promise you won't be disappointed)_

_Also, you've finally made it to the end. CONGRAAAAATS! Suddenly all the feedback I've ever left on your grades seems very short right?_ :D
