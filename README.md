## Since you are a fan of funny GitHub commits, I thought I might as well do it here. 

### So I need to tell you a bunch of things. 

I find you:
+ Cute. _Super cute_.
+ Smart. _Super smart_.
+ Funny. _Super funny_. 

And I would love to go out with you sometime and get to know you, if that’s something that you’re interested in as well.

We could for coffee, or grab a bite somewhere.
And I could tell you some funny/amazing things that cannot go on record ever and I would love to hear what you have to say. 
From what's your favorite color and why, to why you think Kamala Harris is the best bet for the Democrats in 2020. 
From something trivial to something that means everything to you; and anything and everything in between. 

I promise this will be *fun!*

### But, before you answer that, I also need to tell you a bunch of things.

+ I am your TA, which puts this in an ethical gray zone. I would appreciate if you don’t tell anyone about this _for now?_
+ I have *never* graded your *unfairly*. Whatever scores you may have received from me, are purely on *merit*. I’ve never graded you easy in a patronizing manner, or I’ve never graded you harshly. 
+I’ve been as *fair* as possible in my attitude towards you in class and/or slack and haven’t tried to do you undue favors or haven’t tried to give you a cold shoulder because of this.
+Your final project is yet to be graded, but I *_will not_* be grading it in the interest of maintaining fairness. 

So, whatever be your decision, it will *_not_* be impacting your grade. 
Or *_anything_* as a matter of fact. 
I will not hold this against you or have hard feelings if this is something you’re not looking forward to. Remember, _*no pressure*_. 

Irrespective of what happens next, I promise the next time I run into you (_at a Starbucks again? lol_) I will beam a huge smile and wave at you. :D

And now that my spiel is over, let me just sum it:

#U cute. U smart. U funny. U amaze. I like u. U wanna go for coffee?
